Extract the genes related to a genetic disorder from Orphanet
}
\description{
\emph{extract_genes_orphanet} extracts the genes associated to a known genetic 
disorder or a clinical feature from Orphanet database. 
The alias of a disease/phenotye are considered based on HPO database and then 
capture the information in Orphanet.
}
\usage{
extract_genes_orphanet(keyword, 
          localPDB = paste(getwd(),"localPDB",sep="/"), HPO.disease = NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{keyword}{
character string: keyword, to search the disease, clinical feature, or phenotype.
}
  \item{localPDB}{
the path of localized public data bases. The default value is set in the

}
 \item{HPO.disease}{
Orpha Number of the disease. The default value is NULL, which means that 
all the Orpha Numbers of the disease in HPO are added.
}
}
\details{
The function extracts the genes associated to a genetic disease especial 
rare disease, or a clinical feature or phenotype from Orphanet database. 
The keyword is searched not only in Ophanet, but also in HPO considering the
