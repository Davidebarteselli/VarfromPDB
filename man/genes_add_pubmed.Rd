\title{
Compile the disease-related genes from PubMed abstracts into the gene set from the public databases
}
\description{
To compile the genes related to a disease especially for a rare disease from 
PubMed abstracts into the gene set  from the public databases, 
including HPO, orphanet, omim, clinvar and uniprot.
}
\usage{
genes_add_pubmed(genepdb, pubmed, localPDB = paste(getwd(), "localPDB", sep = "/"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{genepdb}{
the object from function \emph{genes_compiled}.
}
  \item{pubmed}{
the object from function \emph{extract_pubmed}. The object need to be checked mannually.
}
  \item{localPDB}{
the path of localized public databases.
}
}
\details{
The relationships between genes and a phenotype are compared with those from public 
databases, then the additional relationships can be merged together. For the object 
from function \emph{extract_pubmed} maybe have noise, we strongly recommend that the 
additional relationships between genes and phenotypes should be pay more attention and 
checked mannually.   
}
\value{
A matrix containing the following information
   \item{GeneSymbol }{gene symbols from HGNC.}
   \item{chr }{chorosomes of the genes.}
   \item{strand }{strands of the genes.}
   \item{start }{start positions (hg19) of the genes.}
   \item{end }{end positions (hg19) of the genes.}
   \item{EntrezGeneID }{Entrez GeneID}
   \item{ApprovedName }{Approved gene name from HGNC.}
   \item{Synonyms }{gene Synonyms.}
   \item{HPO }{the phenotypes from HPO.}
   \item{Orphanet }{the phenotypes from orphanet.}
   \item{OMIM }{the phenotypes from OMIM.}
   \item{ClinVar }{the phenotypes from ClinVar.}
   \item{Uniprot }{the phenotypes from Uniprot.}
   \item{pubmed}{the phenotypes from PubMed.}
